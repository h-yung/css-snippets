# css-snippets
Snippets of styled graphics, free to use. Intended for injection as code blocks, as vanilla as it can get, and with optional JavaScript to add a dash of interactivity. Will be added to at various intervals.

**Demo:** https://h-yung.github.io/css-snippets/

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Optimizations
1. Refactor for greater responsiveness especially for narrowest devices.
2. Check accessibility. E.g., select dropdown is not currently keyboard accessible.

## Lessons learned
- Units of measure (relative vs. absolute) and `position` of parent-child elements can interact in unexpected ways. 
- The dev tools view of JSFiddle is surprisingly noisy.
- A useful resource/color lookup: http://www.fifi.org/doc/wwwcount/Count2.5/rgb.txt.html
