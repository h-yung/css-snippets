# css-snippets
Snippets of styled elements, free to use. Intended for injection as code blocks, as vanilla as it can get, and with optional JavaScript to add a dash of interactivity. Will be added to at various intervals.

**Demo:**

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

## Optimizations
1. Refactor for greater responsiveness especially for narrowest devices.
2. Check accessibility. For one example, select dropdown is not currently keyboard accessible.

## Lessons learned
- Units of measure (relative vs. absolute) and `position` of parent-child elements can interact in unexpected ways. 
- Grid may be more useful in certain scenarios.
